# VBA Quick Keys
These are some VBA subs that I find helpful in Excel. I often use them as quick keys so I can make things run a bit smoother and much quicker.<br>
In here are some scripts that will:
  <li>highlight rows and move to the next.</li>
  <li>send a report with a dynamic date subject, attach a copy, and use the file path in the email body to send to coworkers.</li>
  <li>timestamp a cell.</li>
  <li>add and reply to threaded comments.</li>
  <li>and a function that returns the most recent date of a threaded comment.</li>
